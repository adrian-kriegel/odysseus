'''
Disclaimer: This is a WIP. I haven't verified the resulting OCP solver yet.

Loads a URDF file and generates an NMPC solver for inverse dynamics control.

The resulting controller assumes that the dynamics of the actuated joints are decoupled and linear.
This can be achieved by chaining a computed torque controller (see urdf_computed_torque.py) behind the NMPC controller.

The NMPC model assumes that the system is jerk-controlled, though the jerk is never passed to any lower-level controller. 
It is merely used to ensure that the resulting trajectory is three-times differentiable, which means that it can be exactly
followed via the [PID -> CT] stack.

Alternatively, we could model the acceleration as the input if we modelled the dynamics of the PID controller. 
This would probably lead to issues with the solver "taking advantage" of the oscillations (especially towards
the end of the horizon) if the cost function is not carefully chosen.
